# Bugs of Planet Dune
Programmed C# with Unity to create a 3D video game. Made a world that looks like a sandy area with gates and fungus. The player's site is under attack by big mosquitoes and other big bugs. The player is supposed to shoot the bugs, find gate keys, and escape. The game can be played from the browser, https://captain-garneto.itch.io/bugs-of-planet-dune
